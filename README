Biker tries to be a nice software for planning bike tours. It is 
possible to use it without having a working internet connection, if 
you downloaded some map data beforehand.

Usage:
~~~~~~
First, you need to compile it:
    
    qmake
    make

You should now be able to start it, typing:

    ./Biker

If you have a working internet connection, it should start 
downloading some map data. To be able to do routing, you need to 
load some OSM data. You may use pure .osm files (you can get files 
for some regions from "http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/"). Press 
"Ctrl-O" to open an .osm-file (or choose File->Open). It might take 
some time to load a file, and it uses a huge amount of RAM. Later 
on, I want to improve this part.

If you want to cut some parts out of a file (e.g. to speed up 
loading and decrease RAM usage), you may use "osmosis" to do so.

Planning a route should be pretty intuitive, except zooming: use a 
right click to zoom in, and a click on your wheel (or both buttons) 
to zoom out. This will be improved later on.

It is possible to adjust some parts of the routing algorithm via the right panel.

Please excuse the crappy i18n. Guess it? Later on, ....


Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Biker depends on:
    - libqwt5
    - libcurl
    - libzzip

and, of course, qt4.

If you experience compile problems, try to install these libraries 
(developer version). If you experience problems with libqwt5, adding 
a link in /usr/lib and /usr/include might help:

    ln -s /usr/lib/libqwt-qt4.so /usr/lib/libqwt.so
    ln -s /usr/include/qwt-qt4 /usr/include/qwt5

It might be necessary to change the names. You can also adjust the 
name of the library in the .pro-file
